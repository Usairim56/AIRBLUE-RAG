# ✈️ AIRBLUE-RAG Chatbot

A portfolio project demonstrating a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** built with **Groq's free `gemma2-9b-it` model**, deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, and connected to a custom frontend.

## 📌 About the Project

This project is **not an official AirBlue product**.  
It is a **portfolio project** to showcase skills in:

- RAG-based chatbot design
- Frontend & backend integration
- Using free LLM inference APIs (Groq)
- Working with structured knowledge bases

All data was **collected from publicly available sources** (FAQs, customer service references, query examples) to simulate a realistic airline chatbot experience.

---

## 📂 Data Structure

The chatbot uses a **3-tiered JSON knowledge base**:

1. **Tier 1** – Critical FAQs (CAG queries)  
   - Most important, always prioritized (e.g., ticket booking, cancellation, refund policies).  

2. **Tier 2** – Important operational queries  
   - Flight schedules, baggage allowances, customer support.  

3. **Tier 3** – General information  
   - Company background, non-critical FAQs.  

This tiered design ensures **accurate prioritization of responses**.
